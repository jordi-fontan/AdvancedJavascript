# The goal of functional programming

- [Instructor] So the big question most people ask when they hear about how useful functional programming is is, "What exactly is functional programming?" 
- Well, to answer this question, it might be helpful to consider the question of why we would want to use functional programming in the first place. 
- In other words, what are the problems that functional programming sets out to solve? 
- Well, if you currently use an object-oriented programming language such as Java or C++ or especially a procedural programming language such as C, 
- you've probably run into this problem before. 
- There are certain bugs that are difficult to track down and fix, partly because they're hard to recreate,
- it takes a long, convoluted series of steps to make them show up, and partly because even when you figure out how to recreate them, 
- it's next to impossible for you to keep track of all the changes that occur while the program is running. 

- In a typical enterprise-sized program, thousands of variables are being operated on in thousands of different places at runtime.
- And the application can get itself into buggy states which can be difficult to recreate. 
- This is exactly the type of situation that functional programming aims to avoid. 
- Once you learn to think and program in a functional style, this type of situation will become much less frequent.
- You'll learn many techniques that can be used to create very large, powerful, and virtually bug-free code bases that are composed of many smaller,
self-contained, and easily testable parts.
- So then, at its core, functional programming is concerned with taking a large number of complex ideas present in any large computer program and organizing them 
 in a coherent way, while at the same time making sure that the code remains easy to test and modify. 
 
 - Of course, this sort of organization is what object-oriented programming aims to do as well, although it achieves it with only varied success. 
 - The difference between object-oriented and functional programming is in the choices they make with regards to organizing code. 
 - As you probably know already, the basic idea behind object-oriented programming is that humans think in terms of objects and relationships between these objects, 
 - and therefore computer programs should be organized in terms of objects so that we can leverage our existing thought patterns to write programs more easily. 
 
 - The problem with this, of course, is that our thought patterns are often not as well-defined as we sometimes like to think. 
 - Once we go beyond contrived examples such as SUV is a subclass of car, car is a subclass of vehicle, while demonstrates the concept, but isn't very helpful,
 - the object-oriented programming doctrine doesn't provide much guidance regarding code organization.
 - We're left with a rather daunting array of concepts like interfaces, subclasses, constructors, 
  -public, private, and protected data, accessors, mutators, and mother overriding, all of which form a complicated web of relationships and are prone to abuse
   by all but the most experienced and disciplined programmers. 
   
   - On the other hand, functional programming aims to bring the precision of mathematical functions into computer programs. 
   - While there will always be room for human error in programming no matter what paradigm is being used, adding the provable certainty that comes with mathematics 
    - into computer programming makes it far easier to avoid bugs. 
    
    - Imagine if we were able to represent all parts of a computer program as simply as a mathematical function such as function of x equals x plus one. 
    - Where could a bug possibly be hiding in functions like this? We'll look further into the details of functional programming, 
     along with the many differences between it and object-oriented programming throughout the rest of the course. 
    
     - Since many of you are probably most familiar with object-oriented programming,
     - I'll continue to use it in a lot of comparisons with functional programming to clarify the concepts I show you.
